# JobScraper

## About the Application
This application scrapes available job listings on both Angel List and Indeed for junior developer positions. It makes it easier to search and apply for the available jobs. Each position lists location, title, company, and salary (if listed). So far the searches are limited to the Philadelphia and Houston markets, but a little tweaking in the Server.js file allows for a wider range of geographical locations. This application only runs locally.
